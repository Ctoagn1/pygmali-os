# pygmali-os
A project I'm doing to try and learn more C and low-level development. 
To use, "make" to compile, assemble, and link the sources, "make fs" to make the disk image (note- using the loop device and mounting requires sudo, check the bash script if you want to be sure it's safe), and "make run" to run in in qemu. Right now, it supports basic read functionality- working on writing next!
